# Brazilian Pão de Queijo

## Ingredients

  - 1 cup tapioca starch - (polvilho doce)
  - 2 cup sour tapioca starch - (polvilho azedo)
  - 1 ½ cup semi-hard cheese - grated
  - 1 ½ cup milk
  - ¼ cup oil or melted butter
  - 1 egg
  - 1 tsp salt


## Instructions

  - Preheat the oven to 200 ° C.
  - In a saucepan, mix the milk with the oil/butter and bring it to boil.
  - Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the regular starch with the sour starch and salt.
  - As soon as the mixture of milk and oil/butter boils, scald the starch, that is, pour the hot liquid little by little over the starch mixture. Stir well with a spatula until it has absorbed all the liquid.
  - Wait for the mixture to cool down before continuing to the next step. Otherwise, the eggs will cook and the cheese will melt with the heat.
  - When the mixture is cold enough, add the grated cheese and mix well.
  - Add the eggs and mix well until the dough has incorporated all the ingredients.
  - To shape the cheese bread, put a little oil/butter in your hands, take some of the dough and make small balls. If the dough is too runny you can get the help of a scoop or put it in the fridge a little bit.
  - Bake it for about 30 min or until golden brown.
  - Serve it warm.
